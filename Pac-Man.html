				 The classic Pac-man comes back to life with a twist. 
				 Two player will each control a specific Pac-man character.
				 Within a two minute time limit, both players will try to eat as many pellets as possible while staying alive.
				 Players can die from being caught by the ghosts or caught by a Super sized Pac-man.	 
				 Once there is only one player left then the remaining player wins the game.

				 Some of the major challenges while creating this game was the getting
				 "Collision Detection" feature. For this game, I used Three.JS for this game
				 and which allows for simple and nice looking graphics. However, Three.js
				 doesn't have any feature that will allow you to detect when to objects have
				 collided. For a game like Pac-man, collisions happens almost every second.
				 You collide not only when Pac-man runs into a ghost or wall/boundary, but
				 additionally when you run into another player or when you eat a pellet or
				 special fruit.* Running A* with the four separate ghost and keeping them in
				 sync. Having the ghost target node be a node that test just passed which means
				 that node would be in the closed list, since it cannot go back to a node that
				 it passed.... Ghost in Pac-man, are not allowed to go backwards only forwards.
				 Getting the portal to work on a single computer was super easy lol once it 
				 passed a certain point make it add/sub a certain amount from the height and 
				 Boom the Pac-man was teleported to the next portal. But once trying to 
				 incorporate this on the server, for some reason the Pac-man sprite would
				 continuously bounce between portals. Clickable Meshes were also a very 
				 difficult process. Since my Map included negatives, the collision function I
				 made for Flappy Bird did not transfer nicely to Pac-man. When creating the
				 other Pac-Man, there were a couple problems trying to have Pac-Man sprites
				 appear for the number of Sprites. Also having the game realize when their
				 was only one player remaining was a slightly difficult as well.
